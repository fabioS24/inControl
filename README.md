## Features
### Infinite scrolling
The idea is to make the user aware of how much the page is actually scrolling, so as to break any loops that may form in the user's mind.

### Home redesign and recommendation systems
The home pages of major websites are designed with the aim of providing the user with one reason (or many) to stay connected. Among the most used mechanisms are the recommendation systems. The solution involves modifying the design of the main pages to reduce the effects of these elements, trying to provide only one functionality per page.

Once installed, by clicking on the icon of the extension (in the extension toolbar of the browser) a popup shows all the features and solution that can be enable on each website.
